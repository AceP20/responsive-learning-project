            <h1>Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
            <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to
                the Bootcamp to get expert code review of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>
            <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
                hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using
                what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.

                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what
                I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>

            <h4>How I got started</h4>
            <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
                session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
                also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.

                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
                my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
